    <div class="answer">
      Cybersecurity is a set of technologies, practices, and processes that ensure that internet-connected devices and systems, including mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and desktops, as well as servers, networks, and data, are safe from hackers.

Part of cybersecurity is data protection. It ensures that any attempt by unauthorized people, such as hackers, or technology to access, change or damage your data will be blocked.

    <div class="question">How to Prepare for a Cybersecurity Interview?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      It's safe to say that cybersecurity jobs are among those where technical skills are truly important. It's, of course, required that you know the basics of securing a network and installing a firewall, but technical skills are of equal importance.
While most managers will start the interview with some general questions like 'what do you hope to achieve here?' and 'where do you see yourself in five years?' or 'tell us something that's not on your resume,' they are eventually looking at your technical skills.

Interpersonal and soft skills are also important but in cybersecurity, technical knowledge is critical.

And that's something you need to remember when preparing for your next cybersecurity interview.

Here are a few more tips to help you ace your interview:

    <div class="question">What does a white-hat, black-hat, and grey-hat hacker mean?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      A white-hat hacker, known as an ethical hacker, is a person who uses their hacking skills to find vulnerabilities in companies' networks. White-hat hackers are usually employed by the company under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to hack their systems and servers so that the company can then reinforce its firewalls and cybersecurity protocols.

A black-hat hacker or a malicious hacker is a cybercriminal. Black-hat hackers attack companies' and organizations' networks to uncover private information whether for personal or political gain or for fun.

    <div class="answer">
      Most employers ask about the CIA triad to gauge how you view your role when protecting a large operational system. Provide a definition of the CIA triad and let the hiring manager know if you've used it before and how it worked out.

    <div class="question"> What's the difference between hashing and encryption?</div>
    <div class="answer">
      Hashing is the process of converting data into a different format that only an authorized person can access, whereas encryption involves coding the data where a person with an encryption key or a password can access the data. Hashing offers more data security than encryption.
